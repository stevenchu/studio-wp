					<h3>PRIVACY</h3>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and to enable Website users to enjoy and easily navigate the Website.</p>
<p>Except to the extent you voluntarily include any information about yourself that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”) in Content (e.g., original artwork) you submit to us via the Website, and except for any e-mail address you choose to submit to us via the Website, we do not collect and maintain any Personal Information about you. We may collect other information that you provide or give us access to or otherwise post on the Website or submit to us (“Non-Identifying Information”). Information we collect or you submit is used mainly to provide the Services, send you information about the status of Content you submit to us (e.g., whether we have accepted or rejected it for inclusion in certain aspects of the Services), and to administer your inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Website, our servers automatically record information that your browser or device sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Website and for the Website’s technical administration, to increase our Website’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our users’ needs. We may aggregate, analyze and evaluate Log Data for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</p>
<p><strong>Phishing</strong></p>
<p>Identity theft and the practice known as “phishing” are of great concern to Studio. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your social security number, or national identification numbers in an unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Please make sure you create a strong password and keep it secure. This will also help protect the information of other users on the website as well from being compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Changing or Deleting Your Information</strong></p>
<p>If you would like us to delete your Personal Information, if any, in our database, please put in a <a title="Support" href="http://stevenchustudio.com/support/">Support Ticket</a> and we may attempt to accommodate your request provided we do not have a legal obligation to retain such Personal Information. Please note we may retain server/backup copies of all Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
<p>Our Website contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website or display an ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with any of those third parties, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via conspicuous posting on our Website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
<p> </p>
